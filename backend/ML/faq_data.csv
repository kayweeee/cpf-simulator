What will happen when my Special Account is closed and what is the rationale for doing so? ,"['Today, members aged 55 and above have two CPF accounts that hold savings intended for retirement payouts: the Special Account (SA) and the Retirement Account (RA). Both SA and RA savings earn the same long-term interest rate. However, some SA savings can be withdrawn on demand from age 55. As a principle, only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the long-term interest rate, and savings that can be withdrawn on demand should earn the short-term interest rate.', 'To better align CPF interest rates to the nature of CPF savings in each CPF account, we will close your SA if you are aged 55 and above from early 2025. SA savings will be transferred to your RA, up to your Full Retirement Sum (FRS). These savings will continue to earn the long-term interest rate. If you have met your FRS, whether fully in cash or with a mixture of property and cash, any remaining SA savings will be transferred to your Ordinary Account (OA), where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate.', 'You can choose to transfer your OA savings to the RA at any time, up to the prevailing Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS) to earn long-term interest rates and receive higher retirement payouts. Once transferred, the RA savings can only be streamed out to you in retirement payouts.

Choose your CPF LIFE plan based on how willing you are to adjust your retirement lifestyle, as things become more expensive.', 'If you are worried about the rising costs of living, you can consider the Escalating Plan which provides monthly payouts that start lower initially but grow by 2% every year for life. The growing payouts protects you against inflation and generally helps you maintain your retirement lifestyle. Read more about how the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan works.', ""If you are willing to live a more modest lifestyle and buy less as years pass, you may find the Standard Plan which provides steady payouts suitable for you. Payouts do not grow to protect you against inflation so you'll have to lower your lifestyle to buy less as things get more expensive in the years ahead. Payouts start higher than the Escalating Plan, but will eventually become lower than the Escalating Plan. Read more about how the CPF LIFE Standard Plan works."", 'If you don’t mind starting with lower monthly payouts which will be progressively lower later on, then the Basic Plan is good enough.

As less is used for your CPF LIFE premium, the monthly payout will be lower compared to the Standard Plan.  ', 'The monthly payouts under Basic Plan will get progressively lower when your combined CPF balances eventually fall below $60,000.
